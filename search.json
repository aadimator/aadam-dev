    "text": "Abstract\nClustering is an unsupervised learning task that models data as coherent groups. Multiple approaches have been proposed in the past to cluster large volumes of data. Graphs provide a logical mapping of many real-world datasets rich enough to reflect various peculiarities of numerous domains. Apart from k-means, k-medoid, and other well-known clustering algorithms, utilization of random walk-based approaches to cluster data is a prominent area of data mining research. Markov clustering algorithm and limited random walk-based clustering are the prominent techniques that utilize the concept of random walk. The main goal of this work is to address the task of clustering graphs using an efficient random walk-based method. A novel walk approach in a graph is presented here that determines the weight of the edges and the degree of the nodes. This information is utilized by the pseudo-guidance model to guide the random walk procedure. This work introduces the friends-of-friends concept during the random walk process so that the edges’ weights are determined utilizing an inclusive criterion. This concept enables a random walk to be initiated from the highest degree node. The random walk continues until the walking agent cannot find any unvisited neighbor(s). The agent walks to its neighbors if it finds a weight of one or more, otherwise the agent’s stopping criteria is met. The nodes visited in this walk form a cluster. Once a walk comes to halt, the visited nodes are removed from the original graph and the next walk starts in the remaining graph. This process continues until all nodes of the graph are traversed. The focus of this work remains random walk-based clustering of graphs. The proposed approach is evaluated using 18 real-world benchmark datasets utilizing six cluster validity indices, namely Davies-Bouldin index (DBI), Dunn index (DI), Silhouette coefficient (SC), Calinski-Harabasz index (CHI), modularity index, and normalized cut. This proposal is compared with seven closely related approaches from the same domain, namely, limited random walk, pairwise clustering, personalized page rank clustering, GAKH (genetic algorithm krill herd) graph clustering, mixing time of random walks, density-based clustering of large probabilistic graphs, and Walktrap. Experiments suggest better performance of this work based on the evaluation metrics."

    "text": "Abstract\nIn an urban and uncontrolled environment, the presence of mixed traffic of autonomous vehicles, classical vehicles, vulnerable road users, e.g., pedestrians, and unprecedented dynamic events makes it challenging for the classical autonomous vehicle to navigate the traffic safely. Therefore, the realization of collaborative autonomous driving has the potential to improve road safety and traffic efficiency. However, an obvious challenge in this regard is how to define, model, and simulate the environment that captures the dynamics of a complex and urban environment. Therefore, in this research, we first define the dynamics of the envisioned environment, where we capture the dynamics relevant to the complex urban environment, specifically, highlighting the challenges that are unaddressed and are within the scope of collaborative autonomous driving. To this end, we model the dynamic urban environment leveraging a probabilistic graphical model (PGM). To develop the proposed solution, a realistic simulation environment is required. There are a number of simulators—CARLA (Car Learning to Act), one of the prominent ones, provides rich features and environment; however, it still fails on a few fronts, for example, it cannot fully capture the complexity of an urban environment. Moreover, the classical CARLA mainly relies on manual code and multiple conditional statements, and it provides no pre-defined way to do things automatically based on the dynamic simulation environment. Hence, there is an urgent need to extend the off-the-shelf CARLA with more sophisticated settings that can model the required dynamics. In this regard, we comprehensively design, develop, and implement an extension of a classical CARLA referred to as CARLA+ for the complex environment by integrating the PGM framework. It provides a unified framework to automate the behavior of different actors leveraging PGMs. Instead of manually catering to each condition, CARLA+ enables the user to automate the modeling of different dynamics of the environment. Therefore, to validate the proposed CARLA+, experiments with different settings are designed and conducted. The experimental results demonstrate that CARLA+ is flexible enough to allow users to model various scenarios, ranging from simple controlled models to complex models learned directly from real-world data. In the future, we plan to extend CARLA+ by allowing for more configurable parameters and more flexibility on the type of probabilistic networks and models one can choose. The open-source code of CARLA+ is made publicly available for researchers."

    "text": "Abstract\nEmotions play an important role in human cognition and are commonly associated with perception, logical decision making, human interaction, and intelligence. Emotion and stress detection is an emerging topic of interest and importance in the research community. With the availability of portable, cheap, and reliable sensor devices, researchers are opting to use physiological signals for emotion classification as they are more prone to human deception, as compared to audiovisual signals. In recent years, deep neural networks have gained popularity and have inspired new ideas for emotion recognition based on electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Recently, widespread use of transformer-based architectures has been observed, providing state-of-the-art results in several domains, from natural language processing to computer vision, and object detection. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness and accuracy of a novel transformer-based architecture, called perceiver, which claims to be able to handle inputs from any modality, be it an image, audio, or video. We utilize the perceiver architecture on raw EEG signals taken from one of the most widely used publicly available EEG-based emotion recognition datasets, i.e., DEAP, and compare its results with some of the best performing models in the domain."

In this connection, we design and develop a novel data-driven predictive model which may serve as an intelligent slicing framework for different verticals of smart cities.
