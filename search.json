    "text": "Abstract\nClustering is an unsupervised learning task that models data as coherent groups. Multiple approaches have been proposed in the past to cluster large volumes of data. Graphs provide a logical mapping of many real-world datasets rich enough to reflect various peculiarities of numerous domains. Apart from k-means, k-medoid, and other well-known clustering algorithms, utilization of random walk-based approaches to cluster data is a prominent area of data mining research. Markov clustering algorithm and limited random walk-based clustering are the prominent techniques that utilize the concept of random walk. The main goal of this work is to address the task of clustering graphs using an efficient random walk-based method. A novel walk approach in a graph is presented here that determines the weight of the edges and the degree of the nodes. This information is utilized by the pseudo-guidance model to guide the random walk procedure. This work introduces the friends-of-friends concept during the random walk process so that the edges’ weights are determined utilizing an inclusive criterion. This concept enables a random walk to be initiated from the highest degree node. The random walk continues until the walking agent cannot find any unvisited neighbor(s). The agent walks to its neighbors if it finds a weight of one or more, otherwise the agent’s stopping criteria is met. The nodes visited in this walk form a cluster. Once a walk comes to halt, the visited nodes are removed from the original graph and the next walk starts in the remaining graph. This process continues until all nodes of the graph are traversed. The focus of this work remains random walk-based clustering of graphs. The proposed approach is evaluated using 18 real-world benchmark datasets utilizing six cluster validity indices, namely Davies-Bouldin index (DBI), Dunn index (DI), Silhouette coefficient (SC), Calinski-Harabasz index (CHI), modularity index, and normalized cut. This proposal is compared with seven closely related approaches from the same domain, namely, limited random walk, pairwise clustering, personalized page rank clustering, GAKH (genetic algorithm krill herd) graph clustering, mixing time of random walks, density-based clustering of large probabilistic graphs, and Walktrap. Experiments suggest better performance of this work based on the evaluation metrics."

    "text": "Abstract\nIn an urban and uncontrolled environment, the presence of mixed traffic of autonomous vehicles, classical vehicles, vulnerable road users, e.g., pedestrians, and unprecedented dynamic events makes it challenging for the classical autonomous vehicle to navigate the traffic safely. Therefore, the realization of collaborative autonomous driving has the potential to improve road safety and traffic efficiency. However, an obvious challenge in this regard is how to define, model, and simulate the environment that captures the dynamics of a complex and urban environment. Therefore, in this research, we first define the dynamics of the envisioned environment, where we capture the dynamics relevant to the complex urban environment, specifically, highlighting the challenges that are unaddressed and are within the scope of collaborative autonomous driving. To this end, we model the dynamic urban environment leveraging a probabilistic graphical model (PGM). To develop the proposed solution, a realistic simulation environment is required. There are a number of simulators—CARLA (Car Learning to Act), one of the prominent ones, provides rich features and environment; however, it still fails on a few fronts, for example, it cannot fully capture the complexity of an urban environment. Moreover, the classical CARLA mainly relies on manual code and multiple conditional statements, and it provides no pre-defined way to do things automatically based on the dynamic simulation environment. Hence, there is an urgent need to extend the off-the-shelf CARLA with more sophisticated settings that can model the required dynamics. In this regard, we comprehensively design, develop, and implement an extension of a classical CARLA referred to as CARLA+ for the complex environment by integrating the PGM framework. It provides a unified framework to automate the behavior of different actors leveraging PGMs. Instead of manually catering to each condition, CARLA+ enables the user to automate the modeling of different dynamics of the environment. Therefore, to validate the proposed CARLA+, experiments with different settings are designed and conducted. The experimental results demonstrate that CARLA+ is flexible enough to allow users to model various scenarios, ranging from simple controlled models to complex models learned directly from real-world data. In the future, we plan to extend CARLA+ by allowing for more configurable parameters and more flexibility on the type of probabilistic networks and models one can choose. The open-source code of CARLA+ is made publicly available for researchers."

I’m thrilled to embark on this new chapter of my scientific journey and share it with all of you. As a computer scientist specializing in machine learning and deep learning, I’ve recently taken a plunge into the fascinating realm of bioinformatics, where genomics and data science converge.\nAlthough I thoroughly enjoyed dipping my toes into the vast and mysterious sea of bioinformatics during my graduate-level course on bioinformatics, my decision to fully immerse myself in this realm was driven by my acceptance into the Ph.D. program in bioinformatics at IUPUI, starting this Fall. Along my academic journey, I have explored various fields like quantum computing, artificial general intelligence, and neurosymbolic AI, all with the aim of broadening my horizons. I am a fervent learner, constantly seeking to expand my knowledge and explore new concepts. However, upon delving deeper into the field of bioinformatics, I came to the realization that my understanding was limited, and there was a noticeable scarcity of quality resources to aid in my quest for knowledge. As someone coming from a Computer Science and Machine Learning background, where resources abound, this scarcity became all the more apparent."

    "text": "Two-Language Problem\nHowever, it’s important to acknowledge that Python does suffer from what is often referred to as the “two-language problem”1. While Python excels in high-level scripting, data analysis, and ML/DL tasks, it may not be the most efficient language for computationally intensive or performance-critical tasks. In such cases, bioinformaticians often resort to using lower-level languages like C or C++ to achieve the desired speed and performance.\n1 The “two-language problem” refers to situations where one language is used for high-level data analysis and scripting (often a scripting language like Python or R), while another language is used for performance-critical tasks or lower-level operations (often a compiled language like C++ or Java).This two-language problem poses a challenge for bioinformaticians, as it requires them to switch between Python for its ease of use and extensive libraries, and other languages for computationally intensive tasks. It can lead to code fragmentation, increased development time, and complexities in integrating different components.\nDespite this limitation, Python’s versatility, extensive libraries, and strong ML and DL support still position it as a powerhouse in the field of bioinformatics, enabling researchers to tackle diverse challenges and make significant advancements in their studies. It remains a preferred choice for many due to its ease of use, wide adoption, and vast ecosystem."

While it has seen remarkable growth and adoption in the past couple of years, there may be certain gaps in its ecosystem or limitations in terms of available libraries or tools for specific bioinformatics tasks. Furthermore, Yuri Vishnevsky in his article “Why I no longer recommend Julia”, highlighted his concerns about Julia’s correctness and pointed out specific challenges related to its generality, lack of formal interfaces, and unspecified semantics in certain scenarios. He expressed skepticism about whether Julia’s correctness problems can be effectively resolved given its current design and community practices. It’s crucial for bioinformaticians to be aware of such viewpoints and carefully consider the trade-offs associated with language choices. While Julia offers compelling features and benefits for bioinformatics, including its speed, abstraction, and metaprogramming capabilities, the concerns raised by Vishnevsky emphasize the need for thorough evaluation and consideration of the risks involved.\nJulia’s combination of speed, abstraction, metaprogramming, and its aim to solve the two-language problem make it an enticing option for bioinformaticians. With its growing ecosystem and support from community like BioJulia, the language holds great promise for advancing bioinformatics research and driving innovation in biomedical science."

I think that we still have a long way to go in our pursuit of human-like intelligence.1 Reinforcement Learning domain feels much more closer to human-level AI to me, as compared to vanilla Deep Learning.\n1 I’ll talk later about what I mean by AGI or human-like intelligence, I still need to do some research and reading up on this subject.\n“You cannot achieve general intelligence simply by scaling up today’s deep learning techniques.”\n—Francois Chollet (Google)\n\nBut, I believe that having a better understanding of how our brain works, would give us much more valuable insight on how we should go about solving the artificial intelligence problem. We don’t have to replicate it as is, but it will definitely give us a blueprint using which we can build our own models, which will hopefully be more general and efficient than what we have available currently.\n\n“Understanding how the brain works is the key to building truly intelligent machines.”\n— Jeff Hawkins\n\nDuring my erratic exploration, I came across the field of NeuroAI, and here I’m listing some of the references, which can become useful for anyone interested in exploring this area:\n\nNeuroAI | neuromatch.io: I found this course just one day after the deadline for the new summer school cohort, and was devastated. But thankfully, the team has made all the material from previous cohorts open-source, so we can go through that on our own pace. I’m still going through the prerequisite computational neuroscience course, but I’m eager to start this one once I’m done with that.\nNeuro4ML - Neuroscience for Machine Learners: I’m currently going through this course, as from the title, it seems like this might be designed specifically for people like us–those coming from ML with little to no neuroscience background. I’ll update you down the line on how this adventure pans out.\nThousand Brains Project: This is the project that started me down this path of neuro-inspired AI. I’ve been distantly following the Numenta team for quite some time now, but these past few weeks, I got the chance to dive deeper into their proposed theory. I read the A Thousand Brains: A New Theory of Intelligence and presented that in our weekly literature review meetings. I’ve also gone through the project code and documentation, and I’m still exploring this amazing project. I’m planning on writing a detailed article on what I learned and what I think about this project. I also love how open their research is; it’s not just open-source code, but the open-source their research meetings as well, where they present and discuss new ideas as they are implementing them. This is a valuable learning resource for the uninitiated.\nNeuroAI - The Transmitter: This is another great resource to stay up-to-date on what’s happening in the field and what new research to keep an eye-on."

Undoubtedly, communication networks play the crucial role of backbone to all the verticals of smart cities, which is why we are surrounded by terminologies such as the Internet of Things, the Internet of Vehicles, the Internet of Medical Things, etc. In this paper, we focus on implanting intelligence in 5G and beyond mobile networks. In this connection, we design and develop a novel data-driven predictive model which may serve as an intelligent slicing framework for different verticals of smart cities. The proposed model is trained on different machine learning algorithms to predict the optimal network slice for a requested service resultantly assisting in allocating enough resources to the slice based on the traffic prediction."

    "text": "Abstract\nEmotions play an important role in human cognition and are commonly associated with perception, logical decision making, human interaction, and intelligence. Emotion and stress detection is an emerging topic of interest and importance in the research community. With the availability of portable, cheap, and reliable sensor devices, researchers are opting to use physiological signals for emotion classification as they are more prone to human deception, as compared to audiovisual signals. In recent years, deep neural networks have gained popularity and have inspired new ideas for emotion recognition based on electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Recently, widespread use of transformer-based architectures has been observed, providing state-of-the-art results in several domains, from natural language processing to computer vision, and object detection. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness and accuracy of a novel transformer-based architecture, called perceiver, which claims to be able to handle inputs from any modality, be it an image, audio, or video. We utilize the perceiver architecture on raw EEG signals taken from one of the most widely used publicly available EEG-based emotion recognition datasets, i.e., DEAP, and compare its results with some of the best performing models in the domain."
