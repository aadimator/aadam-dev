<p>Hello, world! With boundless enthusiasm and a touch of wonder, I invite you to explore the captivating world of bioinformatics through this blog. I’m thrilled to embark on this new chapter of my scientific journey and share it with all of you. As a computer scientist specializing in machine learning and deep learning, I’ve recently taken a plunge into the fascinating realm of bioinformatics, where genomics and data science converge.</p>
<p>Although I thoroughly enjoyed dipping my toes into the vast and mysterious sea of bioinformatics during my graduate-level course on bioinformatics, my decision to fully immerse myself in this realm was driven by my acceptance into the Ph.D.&nbsp;program in bioinformatics at IUPUI, starting this Fall. Along my academic journey, I have explored various fields like quantum computing, artificial general intelligence, and neurosymbolic AI, all with the aim of broadening my horizons. I am a fervent learner, constantly seeking to expand my knowledge and explore new concepts. However, upon delving deeper into the field of bioinformatics, I came to the realization that my understanding was limited, and there was a noticeable scarcity of quality resources to aid in my quest for knowledge. As someone coming from a Computer Science and Machine Learning background, where resources abound, this scarcity became all the more apparent.</p>
